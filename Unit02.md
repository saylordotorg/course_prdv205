**Unit 2: THE COURTS AND LITIGATION** <span id="2"></span> 
*A system of justice requires a process for justice.  In general, that
process is available through the court system.  In this unit, you will
learn about the basics of the American court system, which has its
foundation in a network of trial courts that address disputes
surrounding disagreements over facts and how the law applies to those
facts.  If a party decides that the outcome of a trial is
unsatisfactory, that party may decide to appeal the trial court's
decision via an appeals court.  The American judicial system also
provides for intermediate courts of appeal, state supreme courts, and
one ultimate decider, the US Supreme Court.  A decision by a federal
court of appeals or state supreme court may be appealed further to the
US Supreme Court, but any legal issues decided by the Supreme Court may
not be appealed further.  As a business professional, you will need to
possess a working understanding of how this judicial process works and
how the network of state and federal courts affects your work in the
business world.*  
  
 *In general, legal problems between private parties can be addressed in
two basic ways –* *through the courts or through less-formal legal
alternatives.  In this unit, you will explore the process of litigation
as well as other effective methods of handling conflicts.  These
alternative methods are known as alternative dispute resolution, or
ADR.  Going to court is usually an expensive and time-consuming
prospect, and businesses are always looking for ways to more effectively
manage costs and other resources.  As such, businesses attempt to
conserve both money and other assets by first considering ways to
resolve disputes other than formal legal processes.  For example, before
going to court over the failure of a contractor to properly install
equipment for a business, the business might first consider entering
into informal negotiations with the installer in order to reach a
conclusion that is satisfactory to both sides.  If this attempt fails,
the business might propose the use of a mediator to reach a mutually
beneficial result.  Often, business contracts contain a provision
requiring issues to be submitted to arbitration that is run by a
non-governmental official or an organization that acts, in essence, as a
judge and jury in the matter.  If these efforts fail or it is apparent
that ADR is unworkable from the beginning, then a business needs to
consider whether a dispute is best resolved in a court, with all of a
court’s formal requirements and protections.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will examine the process by which businesses
litigate disputes.  You will consider who is involved in litigation and
what procedural requirements must be met in order to successfully
litigate a dispute.  You then will explore the various methods of ADR
that are available to businesses, and consider how these methods may be
used effectively to deal with disputes.*

     Instructions: In Section 3 of Chapter 2, you will learn background
    information about the jurisdiction of various courts in the United
    States.  The US judicial system involves complex webs of
    jurisdiction.  For example, some courts can hold trials, while other
    courts may only hear appeals from earlier trial court decisions.  In
    some situations, a case must be brought first to a state court; in
    other situations, it must be brought directly to a federal court. 
    In addition, some courts have broad jurisdiction, while others
    possess only limited jurisdiction.  This textbook section will lay
    out these basic differences in more detail.  
      
     Note that this reading also covers the material you need to know

    additional guidance on how to approach this reading.

**2.1.2 Trial Courts** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the Chapter 2, Section 3 textbook
reading assigned under Subunit 2.1.1 (above). * *For this subunit, focus
on the textbook’s discussion of trial courts in the United States.  Note
that at the federal level, trial courts are represented by district
courts whose jurisdiction is limited by factors such as whether a
federal law is involved, whether the parties are from different states,
and (in the case of a civil trial) the amount of money involved.  In
addition, all fifty states have their own court systems, with their own
trial and appellate courts.  As you review this material, be sure to
familiarize yourself with the limits and powers of various types of
courts, as well as the types of interaction between state and federal
courts.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 3, Section 5 of the textbook.  This
    reading addresses the different possible outcomes of a trial as well
    as the process of appealing a trial decision.  Note that appeals
    (also called *appellate*) courts usually confine themselves to
    examining whether any errors of law were committed in an earlier
    trial.  As you read, familiarize yourself with the powers that
    appeals courts can exercise when they consider cases that are on
    appeal.  In addition, focus on understanding how power of contempt
    orders can enforce court judgments.
