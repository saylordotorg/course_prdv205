**Unit 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE LAW AND BUSINESS** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit introduces you to the foundations of law in the United States
and provides you with an overview of how various US laws can affect the
operation of American businesses.  *The unique US legal system, which
combines the principles of separation of powers with those of
federalism, has shaped the development of law and policy in the United
States throughout the past 200 years. The three branches of the federal
government – the US president, or executive branch; the US Congress, or
legislative branch; and the federal courts, or judicial branch – each
have separate powers that the other two branches may not influence (a
system known as “checks and balances”).  For example, federal judges are
given lifetime appointments and cannot be removed by the president or
Congress without an impeachment trial.  The separation of powers between
the federal and state governments also shapes the legal process.  Add to
these diverse relationships the existence of laws at the regional,
county, and local levels, and you can see that businesses must deal with
an extensive multitude of various bodies of law.*  
  
 *Following your introduction to the American legal system, you will
learn about the theoretical and legal background of business regulation
in the United States.  Commerce in the US, as in most countries,
operates under a presumption that the rule of law will guide the actions
of businesses and their leaders, particularly with regard to the
regulation of professional relationships, company disputes, and the
exercise of rights.  In this unit, you will explore the impact of the
rule of law on US businesses and gain an overview of several important
laws that regulate companies in the United States.**

     Instructions: Read Section 1 from Chapter 5 of the textbook. Focus
    on this section’s discussion of the separation of powers within the
    United States government.  When the idea of separation of powers was
    introduced in 1789, the concept was considered revolutionary
    because, unlike other governmental models, it ensured that the three
    branches of the American federal government – the legislative,
    executive, and judicial wings – would check and balance each other’s
    duties, scope, and powers.  This concept has had a critically
    important impact on American law, particularly with regard to the
    powers, size, and functions of the federal judicial branch.  Today,
    an independent judiciary is considered a critical component of a
    true system of justice.
