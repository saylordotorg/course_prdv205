**Unit 9: BUSINESS REGULATION** <span id="9"></span> 
*Government regulation is always a topic of debate within the business
community.  In the immediate wake of Enron's massive accounting fraud,
for example, US legislators passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002
to require publicly traded corporations to be more diligent in their
reporting and auditing practices.  Many corporations have since elected
to operate as privately held companies to avoid SOX regulations.  Other
corporations maintain that they must devote so much of their resources
to complying with SOX that they can barely sustain profitability. 
Government regulations are passed all the time, and it is important that
company owners and managers are aware of these changing regulations -
those that already exist, those that are currently being created, and
those that are being proposed for future removal.  All regulation
developments have the potential to affect businesses and their
employees.*

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch the entire video. 
    This video will present you with an overview of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act, passed by the US Congress and signed by President George W.
    Bush in 2002.  This law was introduced to address situations in
    which publicly traded companies were engaging in the misuse and
    misreporting of accounting and financial information.  The
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act attempts to correct prior corporate abuses by
    enforcing stronger penalties that hold corporation executives,
    lawyers, and accountants personally responsible for violations and
    more stringent reporting requirements.  As you watch this video,
    consider how the provisions of this act might affect companies –
    including, perhaps, your own.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this textbook overview of environmental law in
    the United States.  While environmental considerations have been
    part of the law throughout history, these considerations have become
    more prominent beginning in the 1960s, as public concerns about air
    and water pollution have grown.  By the 1970s, the US government had
    created a range of statutes and regulations addressing diverse
    environmental issues such as hazardous waste, pesticides, noise
    control, and radiation.  As you read, familiarize yourself with the
    various laws addressing environmental issues that have been passed
    over the last fifty years.
