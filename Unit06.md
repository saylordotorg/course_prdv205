**Unit 6: EMPLOYMENT LAW** <span id="6"></span> 
*The employer-employee relationship is a key one in the business world. 
Until relatively recently, within the last one hundred years or so, this
relationship was almost completely unregulated.  Even to this day, the
central concept of most employment relationships in the United States is
“at-will employment,” in which an employer can generally fire an
employee for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. 
(Similarly, an employee can leave a job for any reason.)  Historically,
the employment-at-will doctrine has favored employers more than
employees, as the employer usually has more bargaining power than the
employee.  However, recently implemented regulations do offer more
protection to employees.  For example, a comprehensive body of law
protects employees from illegal discrimination based on, for example,
race, ethnicity, or religion.  In addition, federal laws also protect
the right of workers to organize into labor unions and engage in
collective bargaining with employers.  This unit explains these concepts
further and examines other laws and regulations that protect employees,
such as health and retirement account laws.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to:  
-   identify important laws and regulations in employment law;
-   distinguish between *at-will* and *contractual* employment; and

**6.1 At-Will Employment** <span id="6.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Government Regulation and the Legal Environment of
    Business*: “Chapter 18, Section 2: Employment at Will”**

    Will”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Government-Regulation-Ch18.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 18, Section 2 of the textbook.  In
    countries with common law, including the United States, the doctrine
    of *employment-at-will* has been the traditional approach to
    relationships between employers and employees for hundreds of
    years.  But this approach has been significantly modified in
    legislatures and courts since the middle of the
    20<sup>th</sup>century.  As you read this section, be sure you
    understand what the traditional understanding of employment-at-will
    has been in common law, and then familiarize yourself with the
    recent ways in which the doctrine has been modified by courts.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**6.2 Antidiscrimination Laws** <span id="6.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Government Regulation and the Legal Environment of
    Business*: “Chapter 18, Section 1: Federal Employment Discrimination
    Laws”**
    Link: *Government Regulation and the Legal Environment of Business*:
    [“Chapter 18, Section 1: Federal Employment Discrimination
    Laws”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Government-Regulation-Ch18.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 18, Section 1 of the textbook.  One way
    in which the employment-at-will doctrine has been modified over the
    years has been through the setting of laws that protect certain
    classes of people against employment discrimination.  This reading
    will introduce you to laws in the United States that protect
    employees from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, ethnic
    background, religion, disability, or age.  In addition, you will
    learn about the important legal distinction between disparate
    treatment of protected classes (such as racial or ethnic minorities)
    and disparate impact of particular actions on protected classes.  As
    you read, pay particular attention to the basis for affirmative
    action laws and the limits of such regulations in the US legal
    system.  When you have finished this reading, complete the four
    exercises following the “Key Takeaways” box at the end of this
    section.  
      
     Reading this textbook section and completing the exercises should
    take approximately 1 hour.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 18, Section 3 of the textbook.  Over the
    last century, many laws have been passed that give employees greater
    protection in a variety of areas on the job.  Some of these laws,
    for example, address the handling of pensions and other retirement
    programs set up for the benefit of employees.  In addition, all
    states have enacted worker-compensation laws in order to protect the
    financial interests of employees when they are injured on the job. 
    More generally, both the federal and state governments have enacted
    a body of laws meant to protect worker health and safety.  This
    reading will provide you with a concise introduction to these types
    of laws and their application in the workplace.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30
    minutes.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 19, Section 3 of the textbook.  This
    reading covers legal rights under collective bargaining processes
    and agreements.  *Collective bargaining* refers to the process by
    which labor unions gain the right to negotiate and bargain with
    management on behalf of all the employees of a given organization. 
    Laws governing collective bargaining also grant employers certain
    rights.  As you progress through this reading, make sure you
    understand the role of the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB,
    in the process of collective bargaining.  Also make sure you
    understand the various rights and duties of each side as managers
    and employees navigate the employment relationship.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 1 hour.
