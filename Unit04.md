**Unit 4: CONTRACTS** <span id="4"></span> 
*Contracts come in all shapes and sizes and appear in many aspects of
daily life.  For example, you enter into a contract with a broker and/or
seller when you purchase a house.  If you seek reliable work done to
improve your new house, you enter into a contract with a construction
contractor or a general contractor (hence the name).  In the larger
business world, companies enter into contracts with other businesses in
order to set prices and solidify relationships.  
  
 Contracts are legally binding relationships.  In most circumstances, a
contract involves an agreement to deliver a specific product or service
at a specified time on a specified date.  Violating a contract can
result in a lawsuit or a settlement.  While courts may be involved in
this resolution process, such disputes may also be settled outside the
judicial system.  Laws regarding contracts vary from state to state, so
it is always important for you to know the contract law in your area. 
This unit will discuss contracts with a focus on what is known as the
common law, which is the traditional approach to contracts that has been
developed since the late 1700s by English and American judges.  By the
end of this unit, you should have a general familiarity with how most
contracts are written and enforced, particularly under the common
law.*  

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**

-   explain how a contract is formed;
-   identify the key elements of a contract;
-   draft a basic contract; and

    a breach.

**4.1 Contracts: A Case Study** <span id="4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    6, Introduction"**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 6,
    Introduction”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch6.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the introduction to Chapter 6 of the textbook. 
    This reading discusses a real contract case involving the actors and
    directors Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke, and the film studio
    Warner Bros.  Take some time to think about this case and how it
    compares with your own understanding of what a contract is.  Also
    consider the legal consequences of breaking a contract, as well as
    the ethical implications.  Lastly, as you review this reading and
    the readings to follow, be sure to remember that the subject matter
    of a contract must not be illegal (for example, a contract for the
    sale of illegal drugs) in order for the contract to be valid.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30

    “Key Takeaways” box at the end of the section.

    for subunits 4.2.1-4.2.4, found below.  You can refer to those
    subunits for additional guidance on how to approach this reading.

**4.3 Termination and Breach** <span id="4.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    6, Section 2: Performance and Discharge, Breach, Defenses, Equitable
    Remedies"**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 6,
    Section 2: Performance and Discharge, Breach, Defenses, Equitable
    Remedies”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch6.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 6, Section 2 of the textbook.  Once a
    contract is formed and the parties are bound by that contract, the
    parties generally have a legal obligation to perform according to
    the terms of the contract.  Be sure you understand when the
    performance required is only *substantial*, versus when the
    performance is characterized as *strict performance*.  Also note the
    distinction between the prevalent *reasonable person* standard and
    the less-common contractual standard of *personal satisfaction*. 
    While one party's breach of a contract may result in damages, that
    party may also have defenses against such a claim.  Make sure you
    understand these defenses. Lastly, focus on the remedies that are
    available to a party that is the victim of a breach.  When you are
    finished reading, complete the two exercises below the “Key
    Takeaways” box at the end of the section.  
      
     Note that this reading also covers the material you need to know
    for subunits 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, found below.  You can refer to those
    subunits for additional guidance on how to approach this reading.

     Instructions: Read Section 3 from Chapter 6 of the textbook.  Focus
    in particular on this reading’s discussion of the concepts of
    *assignment* and *delegation*.  Simply stated, in many circumstances
    – and depending on the terms of the contract – a party to a contract
    may assign his or her rights to a third party, or delegate his or
    her duties to a third party.  Make sure you understand the
    differences that exist between these two different options.

may apply to situations in which personal performance is intended.*
