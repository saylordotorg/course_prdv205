**Unit 5: NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS AND SECURED TRANSACTIONS** <span
id="5"></span> 
*The UCC addresses two very important areas in modern trade and commerce
– the transfer of money by way of documents that guarantee payment, and
the recording of interests in property serving as security for a loan. 
Most of us are familiar with one kind of negotiable instrument –
checks.  Every day, individuals and businesses pay vendors by way of
check or draft.  Behind these transactions is an extensive body of law
to ensure the orderly transfer of money.  In addition to checks,
promissory notes are also used to guarantee repayment of loans. 
Likewise, laws governing secured transactions provide a framework for
interpreting contracts that provide for collateral on loans and allow a
process for recording such contracts so that creditors are put on notice
regarding earlier collateral interests.  For example, you might get a
loan on a new car, for which the car serves as collateral.  Insuring
contracts for payment of money in commercial transactions helps to
provide for a stable and reliable system of commerce.*

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 28, Section 1 of the textbook.  As you
    are probably aware, some loans are unsecured – for example, the
    loans that generally are offered through credit cards.  Many loans,
    however, are secured – meaning that the lender gets some kind of
    assurance that the loan will be paid.  The UCC provides rules for
    the formation of secured transactions and provides a means to
    “perfect” the security interest.  This reading will provide you with
    a concise introduction to the law of secured transactions.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 1 hour.
