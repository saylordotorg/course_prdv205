**Unit 7: PROPERTY** <span id="7"></span> 
*The idea of property usually strikes people as a fairly simple
concept.  However, the law recognizes that the interests in various
types of property are often anything but simple, and can sometimes
result in highly complex problems.  For example, if you sell your house
to someone, what elements of the house cannot be removed, and, in
contrast, what things can be taken with you when you leave?  Certainly
you have an automatic right to take your clothes, your furniture, and
your photographs and artwork.  But what about a favorite chandelier? 
How about the built-in island counter in the kitchen?  Can you take the
windowpanes?*  
  
 *The law recognizes two categories of property.  There is* *real
property, which is land and anything attached to it, such as a house and
the items physically attached to the house.  In contrast is* *personal
property, which includes everything outside of real property.  As you
work through this unit, ask yourself what types of situations might
render an item personal property, and what situations might render that
same item real property.*  
  
 *In this unit you also will explore the concept of* *intellectual
property, which is a form of personal property.  Intellectual property
represents intangible property rights in the form of words, symbols,
designs, formulas, and other products of the human intellect.  For
example, Coca-Cola has rights to the recipes for its products.  If the
company’s recipes became public knowledge, Coca-Cola might lose its
competitive advantage in the marketplace; as a consequence, Coca-Cola’s
recipes are some of the most closely guarded trade secrets in US
commerce.  As you will learn in this unit, trade secrets are just one
type of intellectual property; and most forms of intellectual property
are protected by federal laws and regulations.*

**7.1 Real Property** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    8, Section 2: Real Property”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 8,
    Section 2: Real
    Property”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch8.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 8, Section 2 of the textbook.  *Real
    property* includes land and personal property that has become
    attachedto land.  The concept of *attachment* is critical in
    deciding whether a piece of property is considered real or personal
    – and thus which body of law applies to that property.  The next
    subunit will cover personal property in more detail; this reading
    will introduce you to the various interests and duties that may go
    into the ownership of real property.  
      
     As you read this section, focus on the unique requirements that
    must be met during the transfer of ownership of real property, and
    the various ways in which such a transfer can be proven through the
    filing of transfer documents.  As you read, pay close attention to
    the concept of *adverse possession*, and consider the following
    questions: Does adverse possession seem fair to you?  Under what
    circumstances might you consider adverse possession to be fair, and
    under what circumstances might you consider it to be unfair?  Note
    that the possession of real property may be transferred *without*
    transferring ownership.  As you complete this reading, make sure you
    have a solid understanding of the various possessory interests that
    arise in real estate.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**7.2 Personal Property** <span id="7.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    8, Section 1: Personal Property”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business:* [“Chapter 8,
    Section 1: Personal
    Property”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch8.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 8, Section 1 of the textbook.  Books,
    cars, shares of stock, and accounts receivable are all examples of
    personal property.  Ask yourself: How are these properties the
    same?  How are they different?  Note that some items that are
    considered personal property under one circumstance may be
    considered real property under another circumstance.  What might
    these different circumstances be?  
      
     As you read this section, consider how transfers of personal
    property occur in our everyday lives.  For example, in the past year
    you have likely bought books, electronics, or even a car – all
    transactions in which you took ownership from a prior owner (either
    a business or an individual person).  As you read, make sure you
    understand the various ways in which the ownership of personal
    property can be transferred.  To better understand these concepts,
    explore the resources within the textbook section box titled
    "Hyperlink: Finders Keepers?"  Be sure you know what legal rights
    and obligations are at stake when the possession of (rather than the
    ownership of) personal property is transferred.

**7.3 Intellectual Property** <span id="7.3"></span> 
**7.3.1 Patents** <span id="7.3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    9, Section 2: Patents”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 9,
    Section 2:
    Patents”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch9.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 9, Section 2 of the textbook.  Patent
    law is an increasingly complex area of the law that generates much
    conflict and controversy.  A patent provides property rights for the
    design of a useful new invention over a certain time period (after
    which the patent expires).  As you read this section, make sure you
    understand the three types of patents, and take note of the kinds of
    products and ideas that may not be patented.  This textbook section
    includes an interesting exploration of whether there is – or should
    be – the ability to patent a living thing.  Be sure to note the
    remedies that are available to patent holders when their patents are
    infringed.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**7.3.2 Trademarks** <span id="7.3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    9, Section 4: Trademarks”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 9,
    Section 4:
    Trademarks”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch9.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 9, Section 4 of the textbook.  Trademark
    law allows a company to secure a claim to a specific identifying
    item that distinguishes the business, such as a name or a design. 
    Consider some of the trademarked items you might be familiar with –
    such as those used by international restaurant chains, software
    companies, and mobile-phone manufacturers.  Companies use trademarks
    to set themselves apart from similar companies and to allow their
    consumers to easily identify their products.  The US government has
    adopted a specific regimen of laws to protect such trademarks.  As
    you read, note the many identifying categories that may be
    trademarked, such as the shape of a bottle.  Take note, too, of what
    may not be trademarked under US law.  Lastly, be aware of the
    remedies that are available to trademark holders following the
    infringement or dilution of their trademark, as well as the defenses
    that can be made by an alleged infringer against a
    trademark-holder’s claims.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 45
    minutes.

**7.3.3 Copyright** <span id="7.3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    9, Section 5: Copyright”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 9,
    Section 5:
    Copyright”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch9.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Copyright is another area of intellectual property
    law that has grown more controversial over the past twenty years,
    particularly with the rise of the Internet.  The arrival of the web
    has allowed for an astronomical rise in the availability of original
    written content and other creative material to the general public. 
    For some users, this easy access can lead to confusion about the
    ownership of web material, including the assumption that such
    material may be used by any person for any reason.  In addition,
    other web users have intentionally sought to bypass the protections
    available to owners of such material.  Some see the copyright
    protections available to such creative work as excessively
    restrictive, and through various efforts these users attempt to
    promote the availability of creative work through open copyright
    licenses.  As you read this textbook section, familiarize yourself
    with the protections that US law provides to copyright holders. 
    Note the ways in which digital copyright licenses can further
    restrict the use of digital media, and be sure to pay attention to
    the remedies that are available to a copyright holder following a
    copyright infringement (as well as the defenses that an accused
    copyright infringer might make against such an allegation).  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**7.3.4 Trade Secrets** <span id="7.3.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    9, Section 3: Trade Secrets”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 9,
    Section 3: Trade
    Secrets”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch9.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Section 3 from Chapter 9 of the textbook. 
    Trade-secret laws generally protect businesses that wish to maintain
    the confidentiality of such properties as formulas, processes, or
    client lists due to the important economic value that these
    properties provide.  Unlike US trademark, patent, and copyright
    laws, trade-secret laws in the United States are covered only by
    individual state laws, not federal law.  Make sure you understand
    both the civil and the criminal penalties that a party might face
    when it is accused of stealing a trade secret, as well as the
    defenses that an accused party might mount against such a claim.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 15
    minutes.
