**Unit 8: TORTS AND CRIMINAL LAW** <span id="8"></span> 
In addition to the civil disputes that fall under contract law, two
other branches of law have a major impact on the operation of
businesses: torts law and criminal law.  
  
 Torts is a branch of law that imposes liability for civil wrongs that
are not related to the violation of contracts.  Consider the following
example: Your company’s delivery truck is hit by another vehicle, and
you want to sue the other driver on behalf of your company for damaged
goods.  But there is no previous contract that exists between you and
the other driver.  In such a situation, your lawsuit will be carried out
within the tort system.  Tort law allows individuals and businesses that
have been wronged to receive compensation for that wrongdoing.  There
are a number of different types of civil wrongs (torts), but the most
commonly cited tort is negligence, which involves a breach of “duty of
care.”  In order to sue on the grounds of negligence, you must be able
to prove that a person or party who was responsible for something has
violated that responsibility.  
  
 Like torts, criminal law deals with what happens when an individual or
group of individuals commits a wrong against another individual or group
of individuals.  For example, Bernie Madoff was successfully prosecuted
in 2009 for securities fraud when it was revealed that his
investment-management business was not actually investing but rather
taking money from later investors to pay off earlier investors.  Unlike
contract disputes, criminal actions pertain to the direct violation of
existing laws that a legislature has determined represent a pressing
societal interest and thus require prosecution by the state or federal
government.  As with contract law and torts law, criminal law cases
usually include two parties – the prosecution and the defense – but in
US criminal trials, the defense is always representing a regional,
state, or federal government.  A criminal trial also includes a judge
and, in many cases, a jury of peers.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 7, Section 1 of the textbook. 
    Intentional torts refer to wrongful actions that have been committed
    purposefully by a person or group.  As you read this section, note
    the wide variety of intentional torts that the legal system
    recognizes.  Some of these torts, such as battery and conversion,
    also have the potential for criminal liability.  While many
    intentional torts are committed by one person against another, these
    torts may also include purposeful damage to real or personal
    property.

**8.1.2 Negligence** <span id="8.1.2"></span>

    7, Section 2: Negligence”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business:* [“Chapter 7,
    Section 2:
    Negligence”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch7.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 7, Section 2 of the textbook.  Have you
    ever been around someone who acts carelessly and ends up breaking
    something?  If you become angry with and confront such a person, he
    or she might answer, "I didn't do it on purpose."  But the tort
    known as negligence tells us that even when a person does not
    intentionally commit a wrong, he or she still may be held
    accountable if he or she is found not to have exercised proper
    care.  The common standard used in judging such situations is to ask
    what a “reasonable” person would do in the same situation – that is,
    a person exercising adequate care, skill, and judgment in similar
    circumstances.  As you read, be sure to familiarize yourself with
    the different elements that compose negligence.  If a particular
    case meets all the elements of negligence, then it becomes necessary
    for a court to determine the level of damages due to the wronged
    party.  Also be sure to note the textbook's description of defenses
    that can be mounted against a charge of negligence.

**8.1.3 Strict Liability** <span id="8.1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    7, Section 3: Strict Liability”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 7,
    Section 3: Strict
    Liability”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch7.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Section 3 from Chapter 7 of the textbook.  The
    law recognizes that some torts require holding persons liable for
    their acts even when they are deemed to have exercised reasonable
    care.  How could this be?  This reading outlines the various
    situations in which persons are held to *strict liability*.  Do you
    agree that such situations require a stricter level of
    accountability?  For businesses that engage in the manufacture or
    sale of goods, *product liability* has emerged as an important area
    of business law.  Pay particular attention to this reading’s
    discussion of product liability.  
      
     Note that this reading also covers the material you need to know
    for subunits 8.1.3.1 and 8.1.3.2, found below. You can refer to
    those subunits for additional guidance on how to approach this
    reading.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**8.1.3.1 Traditional Strict Liability** <span id="8.1.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the Chapter 7, Section 3 textbook
reading assigned under Subunit 8.1.3 (above).  For this subunit, focus
on reviewing how strict liability applies to ultra-hazardous and
inherently dangerous activities.  Such activities are ones to which
strict liability has traditionally applied as a result of social and
judicial policies, such as keeping dangerous or wild animals or
transporting explosives.*

**8.1.3.2 Product Liability** <span id="8.1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: this topic is covered by the Chapter 7, Section 3 textbook
reading assigned under Subunit 8.1.3 (above).  For this subunit, focus
on the application of strict liability to product liability.  The
concept of strict product liability represents a relatively recent and
developing area of torts law.*

-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    10, Section 1: The Nature of Criminal Law, Constitutional Rights,
    Defenses, and Punishment”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 10,
    Section 1: The Nature of Criminal Law, Constitutional Rights,

     Instructions: Read Chapter 10, Section 1 of the textbook.  This
    section provides you with an overview of criminal law, including
    constitutional protections for criminal defendants, defenses to
    criminal allegations, and the nature of punishment in criminal law. 
    Pay particular attention to this section’s discussion of the burden
    of proof in criminal cases.  Compare this burden to the burden of
    proof in civil cases, and note the apparent contradictions that
    arise from different characterizations of the burden of proof. 
    Following your reading, complete Exercise 2 under the “Key
    Takeaways” box at the end of the section.  
      
     Reading this textbook section and completing the exercise should
    take approximately 45 minutes.

    section covers the more notable types of what are known as
    “white-collar” crimes in business.  It is important to note that
    business-related crimes can extend beyond high-profile white-collar
    crimes.  For example, property crimes may be committed by any
    employee.  In addition, businesses may violate regulatory statutes
    that have criminal penalties, such as environmental laws.  Be sure
    to familiarize yourself with the most common criminal offenses, both
    white-collar and otherwise, that occur in business settings.  
      
     Note that this reading also covers the material you need to know
    for Subunit 8.2.3, found below.  You can refer to that subunit for

that business-related crime can involve a range of potentially illegal
activities, from the illegal dumping of hazardous wastes to small-scale
employee theft.*
