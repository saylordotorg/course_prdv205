**Unit 3: BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS** <span id="3"></span> 
*Corporations are legal entities that protect shareholders from certain
legal liabilities.  For example, if you start a sole proprietorship and
take out a small business loan to get started, you are personally liable
for that loan.  If you do not repay the loan, the bank providing the
loan can pursue the seizing of your personal assets.  If you are a
shareholder in a corporation that fails to pay its loans, however, the
bank providing the loan cannot pursue your personal assets.  
  
 The operation of a corporation faces certain restrictions and caveats. 
For example, corporations are subject to more regulations and fees than
most other business entities.  However, the corporate form is only one
of many types of business organization that are available to a modern
company.  In this unit, you will explore the various types of business
entities in the United States, weigh the pros and cons of each, and
consider the issues of liability and tax consequences as they relate to
these entities.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 11, Section 1 of the textbook.  *Sole
    proprietorships*are the most common form of business organization,
    with good reason: There are no formal requirements to start a sole
    proprietorship.  As you read this section, consider the other
    advantages of starting a business as a sole proprietorship.  (Also
    note the disadvantages of this type of business organization.)  Be
    sure to click on the hyperlink inside the box titled “Hyperlink:
    Small Businesses Squeezed as Banks Limit Lending” to gain insight
    into the challenges of borrowing money as a sole proprietor.  Also
    be sure you understand the issue of liability in sole
    proprietorships, as this discussion will provide you with a
    foundation for future course discussions on limited liability forms
    of organization.

**3.1.4 Limited Liability Companies** <span id="3.1.4"></span>

    11, Section 4: Limited Liability Entities”**

    Entities”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Legal-Ethical-Environment-Ch11.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Section 4 from Chapter 11 of the textbook. 
    *Limited liability companies* (LLCs) are a relatively new form of
    business organization in the United States, but they are already
    used widely, particularly by small businesses.  In contrast with the
    many formalities and structural limitations required of
    corporations, LLCs offer a simpler alternative that is more suited
    to small businesses.  An LLC can have a single member or multiple
    members, and the registration and administrative requirements for
    these businesses are much less complicated than those for
    corporations.  Note, in particular, the similarities and differences
    among LLCs, sole proprietorships, and corporations.  Why do you
    think the textbook refers to LLCs as a “hybrid” entity?  Make sure
    you familiarize yourself with the requirements that must be met to
    form and organize an LLC.  Following your reading, complete the two
    exercises below the “Key Takeaways” box at the end of the section.  
      
     Note that this reading also covers the material you need to know
    for Subunit 3.1.5, found below.  You can refer to that subunit for
    additional guidance on how to approach this reading.  
      
     Reading this textbook section and completing the exercises should
    take approximately 30 minutes.

organizations that provide limited liability and tax advantages to
professional partnerships such as law firms and accounting firms.*
