**Unit 10: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE** <span
id="10"></span> 
*Now that you have explored various areas of business regulation in the
US, you are probably wondering how businesses deal with the many legal
requirements they are subject to.  For public corporations, managing
compliance with government regulations is especially a challenge, given
the accounting and securities regulations that have been put in place
since 2002.  Recently, the position of “Chief Compliance Officer,” or
CCO, has taken on an important role in corporate governance.  However,
the CCO cannot be the only corporate leader concerned with issues of
compliance and corporate liability for violating regulations. 
Particularly after the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, corporate
leaders may be held personally liable if they fail to act on information
suggesting noncompliance with accounting and other regulations. 
Corporate executives and members of the board of directors must also
remain vigilant.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will look at the practicalities of applying
government regulations in the corporate environment.  You will review
the reforms of the past decade and consider their effects on corporate
culture.  The readings in this unit will also highlight the role of a
company’s board of directors in corporate governance, particularly in
relation to a board’s duty of oversight.  Lastly, you will learn about
how companies deal with “red flags” – warning signs that compliance
problems may be arising – as well as questions that need to be
considered when a corporation sets out to address compliance issues.*

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3 hours to complete.

**Unit10 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to:

**10.1 Corporate Governance Reform** <span id="10.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Corporate Governance*: “Chapter 4, Section 1: Recent
    Governance Reforms: An Executive Summary”**
    Link: *Corporate Governance*: [“Chapter 4, Section 1: Recent
    Governance Reforms: An Executive
    Summary”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Corporate-Governance-Ch4.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This reading provides you with an overview of reforms
    implemented over the past decade or so that relate to corporate
    governance.  As your previous readings have shown, the US Congress
    instituted a major reform to corporate governance regulations with
    the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  In addition, there are other
    reforms that impact the conduct of corporate governance and the
    legal liabilities faced by corporate boards and executives.  Be sure
    you understand the reasoning behind these reforms, as you will
    consider the effects of these reforms later in this unit.

**10.2 The Current Regulatory Climate** <span id="10.2"></span>

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This reading provides you with a consideration of the
    effects of corporate governance reforms as they are experienced in
    the current regulatory environment.  Note in particular the enhanced
    role of the audit committee.  Why do you think this expansion of the
    audit committee’s duties has come about?

**10.3 The Duty of Oversight** <span id="10.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Corporate Governance: “Chapter 6, Section 3: Legal Issues
    Regarding Oversight”**
    Link: *Corporate Governance*: [“Chapter 6, Section 3: Legal Issues
    Regarding
    Oversight”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Corporate-Governance-Ch6.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This reading provides you with an overview of the
    legal issues related to a corporate board's duty of oversight. 
    While corporate boards are often protected by the Business Judgment
    Rule – which absolves directors of liability if they act on an
    informed basis and in good faith – this protection does not apply if
    directors do not act with good judgment.  By failing to exercise
    appropriate oversight, a board may face liability.  As you finish
    your reading, ask yourself what a board can and should do in the
    face of “red flags” that indicate possible violations of the law.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**10.4 Considerations in Building Effective Corporate Governance and
Compliance** <span id="10.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Corporate Governance*: “Chapter 6, Section 4: Red Flags
    in Management Culture, Strategies, and Practices"; “Chapter 6,
    Section 5: Questions about Ethics and Compliance for the Board”; and
    “Chapter 13, Appendix B: Red Flags in Management”**
    Link: *Corporate Governance*: [“Chapter 6, Section 4: Red Flags in
    Management Culture, Strategies, and
    Practices”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Corporate-Governance-Ch6.pdf)
    (PDF); [“Chapter 6, Section 5: Questions about Ethics and Compliance
    for the
    Board”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Corporate-Governance-Ch6.pdf)
    (PDF); and [“Chapter 13, Appendix B: Red Flags in
    Management”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Corporate-Governance-Ch13.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: As the your previous readings indicate, it is
    important for boards and directors to be aware of red flags that
    could result in liability upon a failure to act.  For example, if
    directors ignore emails indicating irregularities in the
    corporation's accounting, they may find themselves facing lawsuits
    and government investigations.  Chapter 6, Section 4 of the textbook
    provides a consideration of these red flags, such as too frequent
    changes in business strategies.  In addition, Section 5 of the
    chapter provides a list of questions that corporate leaders should
    consider when addressing issues of ethics and compliance and
    developing appropriate policies.  Lastly, Chapter 13, Appendix B
    explores in greater depth the issue of red flags, with a particular
    focus on certain common issues that corporations face – such as a
    managerial focus on rapid, short-term revenue growth or driving up
    the stock price – that may indicate compliance problems.  
      
     Reading this textbook section should take approximately 1 hour.
