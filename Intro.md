When most people think about business, the relationship between business
and the law may not be the first consideration that comes to mind.  Bus
the law has a major impact on the operation of a successful business. 
For example, businesses face a range of government legal regulations,
from laws preventing employment discrimination to rules requiring
efforts to protect the environment.  In addition, businesses must make
important legal decisions from their founding, such as which
organizational form they will take, how they will conduct their daily
operations (such as making contracts and protecting consumers), and how
their potential liquidation will be handled.  Both business
administrators and business-law paralegals must familiarize themselves
with the range of laws surrounding business as well as the range of
operational practices that businesses must implement in order to address
the legal challenges of running a company. This course will introduce
you to the legal knowledge and skills that business administrators and
paralegals must possess.  First, you will explore the basics of the
American legal system and examine the specific areas of business
practice that the law impacts and regulates - such as torts, contracts,
and criminal action.  Then, you will practice important skills related
to these areas, such as learning how to draft basic legal documents,
make registrations and other filings, and communicate legal and
regulatory requirements to company executives and employees.  By the
time you have completed this course, you will understand the key legal
aspects of operating a business, as well as the foundational skills that
certain employees must possess in order to address the legal and
regulatory issues that are faced by today's businesses and companies.
